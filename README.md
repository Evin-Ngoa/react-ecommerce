# react-ecommerce
### [Live Site](https://evin-react-ecommerce-112021.netlify.app/)
A simple fully functional eCommerce application using commerce.js as the backend.

While building it I learnt many advanced React & JavaScript topics, as well as how to use Stripe for card transactions.

### For Payment, I used stripe
Use the following Card details to checkout or type `42` repeatedly to the end.
`4242 4242 4242 4242`
`04 / 24`
`242`
`42424`

### Available Functionalities
1. Add To Cart
2. View Cart Page 
3. Increment / Decrement Cart Quantity
4. Remove Item from Cart
5. Clear Cart
6. Add Shipping Address
7. Checkout using stripe payment gateway. - Intentionally made an error to prevent submission.

### Project Goal
- To learn React by making a basic ecommerce with core functionalities as fast as possible. I used CHEC PLATFORM (commerce.js) to
provide backend API
- Learn Project deployment to netlify through github.
- Git : Use of multiple branches and pull requests.

## Running the project

### `Git clone`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

# Enjoy!
